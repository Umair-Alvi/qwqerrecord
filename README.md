Project Overview

This is a single-page dashboard project built during my early learning days.

The purpose of this project was to practice:

Admin panel layout

Page navigation

Order listing flow

The Home Page provides a simple entry point, and on click, it navigates to the All Orders page.

🚀 Why This Project Matters

Built during my beginner phase

Focused on real-world dashboard structure

Helped me understand basic navigation and UI flow

This project reflects my starting point as a developer and my growth towards more structured applications.
